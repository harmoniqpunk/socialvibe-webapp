# Product Description: SocialVibe WebApp

## 1. Introduction

The SocialVibe WebApp is a SvelteKit-based frontend application designed to serve as an intelligent interface for social media engagement, initially targeting X (formerly Twitter). It aims to provide users with a "Reply Guy Command Center" to efficiently manage and optimize their interactions on the platform. The application integrates a Rust-based WebAssembly (WASM) module (`socialvibe-lib`) for potential performance-critical tasks or specialized logic.

## 2. Vision

To empower users with an AI-enhanced dashboard that helps them identify high-priority social media posts, craft effective replies, and manage their engagement strategy to grow their online presence.

## 3. Core Problem Statement

Users aiming to build a social media presence often struggle with:
-   Identifying the most impactful posts to engage with from a high volume of content.
-   Consistently crafting contextually relevant and high-quality replies.
-   Managing engagement efficiently to maximize visibility and follower growth.
-   Keeping track of trending conversations and latest posts from key accounts.

## 4. Target Users

-   Individuals (like Mihnea and George) looking to build a personal brand or niche following on X.
-   Content creators and influencers seeking tools to streamline their engagement and audience growth.
-   Small business owners aiming to increase their visibility within specific online communities.

## 5. Key Features & Functionality (Inspired by TwitterEngagementDashboard Mock)

The web application is envisioned to provide functionalities similar to the `mihneas-mock/TwitterEngagementDashboard.jsx` component, but implemented in SvelteKit:

* **Dashboard Interface:** A central hub for viewing and interacting with social media posts.
* **Tabbed Navigation:**
    * **Latest Posts:** A live or frequently updated feed of recent posts from monitored sources or based on certain criteria.
    * **Trending Posts:** A curated list of posts with high engagement or viral potential.
* **Post Prioritization:** Visual cues (e.g., color-coding based on engagement metrics like "high", "medium", "low" priority) to help users focus on impactful interactions.
* **Detailed Post View:** Displaying post content, author information, engagement statistics (likes, retweets, replies, impressions), and timestamp.
* **Interactive Reply Modal:**
    * Displaying the original post content for context.
    * Providing a list of "Quick Replies" (pre-defined or AI-suggested templates).
    * Allowing users to write and send "Custom Replies".
    * Functionality to save custom replies as new templates.
* **Post Management:** Ability to "skip" or dismiss posts from the feed.
* **Dynamic Updates:** The "Latest Posts" feed should simulate a live feed with new posts appearing periodically.
* **WASM Integration:** The `socialvibe-lib` (Rust/WASM) can be used for tasks like:
    * Client-side data processing or filtering.
    * Complex calculations for engagement scoring (if performed client-side).
    * Any utility functions that benefit from Rust's performance or safety, callable from the Svelte/TypeScript frontend.

## 6. Success Metrics

* User engagement with the dashboard features.
* Efficiency gains in managing social media interactions (e.g., time to reply).
* User satisfaction with the quality and relevance of information presented.
* Adoption rate of features like "Quick Replies" and "Custom Reply".

## 7. Non-Goals (Initially for the WebApp Frontend)

* Directly managing user's social media accounts (posting, liking on their behalf without backend API calls). The frontend is an interface; actual social media interactions might be brokered by a backend (not defined in this specific `socialvibe-webapp` repo).
* Advanced AI-driven reply generation *within the frontend itself* (this would likely be a backend service that the frontend consumes). The WASM module is for client-side enhancements, not full LLM operations.
* Supporting platforms other than X, unless explicitly planned.

## 8. Underlying Principles

* **User Efficiency:** Streamline the process of identifying and responding to relevant social media content.
* **Clarity & Focus:** Provide a clear, prioritized view of engagement opportunities.
* **Customization:** Allow users to adapt reply strategies to their own voice.
* **Modern Web Technologies:** Leverage SvelteKit, TypeScript, and WebAssembly for a responsive and potentially performant user experience.
